# The_Program

So far the goal of this program is to create an interface for a budgeting software that me and my roommate can use to automate and track our budget so we can worry alot less about our money and start accumulating wealth where the program can find it

long term goals for this program is to have something that can interact with most everything we do, im hoping to write api to automatically track purchases, check spending habits based on times of the year and other factors, maybe get a model to predict user spending habits to adjust the budget for enhanced user experience, i will also eventually write an ai algorthm to predict the stock market and allow that ai model to trade on the real market, or have an option for users to have the ai alert them for potentially good ideas instead of actually trading, i will also eventually have this aplication create and edit calenders and schedules to automate planning events, like have the system check the users schedules and offer a few options for times and dates to figure out when works best for all parties inclued, while also predicting travel time and expenses and paths for the event. There will be plenty of other features, these are just a few on the top of my head, i plan on this application eventually running as almost a 'smart hone' server connecting to most parts of our lives to help me and my roomamte or anyone that ends up using this program to make life hopefully a bit less stressful by automating the not so fun parts
